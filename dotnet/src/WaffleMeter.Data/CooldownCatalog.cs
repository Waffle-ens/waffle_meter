/// <para><b>What it deliberately does NOT provide is the cooldown length.</b> The client value is not the
/// player's cooldown: a cooldown-reduction stat scales it, skill level cuts it by up to 65%, and a
/// specialization can cut it further or zero it outright — 106 of the 249 skills cannot be resolved from the
/// tables at all. It is not even an upper bound (호법성 회전격 came over the wire at 22,200 ms against a table
/// value of 10,000). The wire is the authority: 0x3802 carries the character's real total on every cast and
/// 0x3847 corrects the remainder. The catalog is here for identity, not arithmetic.</para>
/// <para>Its second job is <see cref="GroupId"/>. Cooldowns are keyed by the client's shared-cooldown group,
/// not by folding the skill code, because both naive schemes fail: the raw wire code is a specialization
/// variant 99.4% of the time (so nothing would ever match), while <c>code / 10000 * 10000</c> collapses

/// generator used to emit without an icon are all dummies or skills that no longer exist — the client table
/// still carries them, but no icon was ever assigned, and that absence turned out to be the tell. Filtering
/// them out at generation is what keeps the picker, the overlay and the job pre-fill consistent in one place.
/// The risk it buys is the opposite one: a genuinely new skill whose icon has not been extracted yet would
